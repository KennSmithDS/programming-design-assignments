# Assignment 4 - Random Sentence Generator

In this assignment, we are tasked to revolutionize student productivity by creating a application that randomly generates sentences for term papers, poetry and insults that students can insert into their assignments to fill up blank space.  The random sentences are generated by depending on JSON files that define grammar rules for this random language. For the sake of simplicity, we only generated one new grammar file for test cases, but the rest of the default provided grammar types provided were used, and no new grammars were created.

## Setup

There is one core dependency for this Java application to work, and that is a library that comes from the Apache Commons:

```
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.json-simple/json-simple
```

You will need to make sure that this library is downloaded and available in your global java library for the application to work if running the application within an IDE or CLI.

## ** Make sure you are in assignment 4 folder when running the program in terminal **

## Usage

In order to run this application, you simply need to enter one argument at the commandline which is the full or implicit directory path to a folder containing JSON files:

```
java -jar RandomSentenceGenApp.jar ./json/
```

With this command line above, the application will launch and the user will see the following prompt menu:

## ** based on the JSON grammar files in your own folder, the menu option names will be different **

```
The following grammars are available :
[1] Insult Generator
[2] Poem Generator
[3] A sample grammar
[5] Term Paper Generator

Please enter a number corresponding to one of the options above, or 'q' to quit.
```
From here the user can type the interger value for the menu option corresponding to that grammar type file found in the defined directory. As long as the user inputs a valid integer within the range equal to the number of unique grammar files, the program will keep cycling and giving the user the choice of different sentences types. Finally, the application can be quit if the user inputs 'q'.  If any other letters or invalid numbers/characters are passed, then the application will fail with an error.

## Examples

Example command line arguments for generating emails from customer data:

```
java -jar RandomSentenceGenApp.jar ./json/

The following grammars are available :
[1] Insult Generator
[2] Poem Generator
[3] A sample grammar
[5] Term Paper Generator

Please enter a number corresponding to one of the options above, or 'q' to quit.
1
With the rage of a pissed-off Jabberwock , may a rancid hoard of crazed cockroaches find your buttocks suddenly delectable .

Enter a number corresponding to one of the menu options for another grammar, or 'q' to quit.
2
