# Student Repo
This is the repo that you will use to submit your homework assignments.  
Commit early, commit often, and then push.  
Make sure you push your changes to the server.  This will help make sure your work is backed up as well as allow Instructors and TAs to help you in case of any problems. 

## Topic Branches
It is best to create a topic branch to do your work and then merge that branch, via a pull request, into the master branch.
